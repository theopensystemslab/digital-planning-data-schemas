# Digital planning data schemas docs

This is an experimental subfolder for JSON Schema viewers & documentation generators.

We're currently trying out [@stoplight/json-schema-viewer](https://github.com/stoplightio/json-schema-viewer) on top of a basic [vite/react-ts](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) starter site.

## Local dev

pnpm i
pnpm dev
